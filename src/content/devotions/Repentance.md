### **Repentance**

I believe that **repentance** is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to walk in obedience to God. Repentance is not merely a human decision but a grace granted by God, wrought by the Holy Spirit, and a response to the realization of God’s holiness and our own sinfulness. As Paul writes, *"The kindness of God leads you to repentance."* **(Romans 2:4)**. It is God’s goodness and mercy, shown supremely in Christ’s sacrificial work, that draws sinners to genuine repentance.

Repentance involves a change of heart and mind that results in a transformed life. It is a recognition of the gravity of sin and a turning away from it, motivated by a desire to honor and glorify God. This turning is not in human strength alone, for Scripture affirms that repentance is a gift granted by God: *"God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth."* **(2 Timothy 2:25)** and *"He disciplines us for our good, so that we may share His holiness."* **(Hebrews 12:10-11)**.

The writer of Hebrews also warns of the danger of hardened hearts, as exemplified by Esau, who *"found no place for repentance, though he sought for it with tears."* **(Hebrews 12:17)**. This illustrates the seriousness of sin and the urgency of turning to God while He extends His grace. True repentance is characterized by a godly sorrow that leads to life, not mere regret or worldly sorrow that leads to death. *"For the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance without regret, leading to salvation."* **(2 Corinthians 7:10)**.

Thus, repentance is a necessary and ongoing aspect of the Christian life, a continual turning from sin and drawing near to God through Jesus Christ. It is through His redemptive work that we are given the power to repent, and it is in His grace that we find forgiveness and restoration.
