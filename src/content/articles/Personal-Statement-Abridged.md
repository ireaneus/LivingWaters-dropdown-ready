## The Message of the Bible
I believe that the central message of the Bible is the establishment of God’s Kingdom, redeeming His people for His glory. The Scriptures, being the inspired and infallible Word of God, are the foundation of all Christian belief and practice.

## The Chief End of Man and the Purpose and Providence of God
### The Chief End of Man
I believe that the chief end of man is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever. As Isaiah declares, *"Bring My sons from afar and My daughters from the ends of the earth, everyone who is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory."* **(Isaiah 43:6-7)**. Humanity finds ultimate satisfaction in Him, as *"In Your presence is fullness of joy; in Your right hand there are pleasures forever."* **(Psalm 16:11)**.

### The Providence of God
I believe in the **providence of God**, where He sovereignly governs all events. *"In Him we live and move and have our being."* **(Acts 17:28)**. While I am responsible for my actions, His care directs my steps. *"The mind of man plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps."* **(Proverbs 16:9)**.

## The Bible
I believe that the Bible, comprising sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments, is God’s inerrant and infallible revelation. It is *"inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness."* **(2 Timothy 3:16-17)**. Scripture is to be interpreted within its historical and grammatical context, led by the guidance of the Holy Spirit. *"The Spirit of truth... will guide you into all the truth."* **(John 16:13)**.

# The Nature of God

## God the Father
God the Father is the sovereign Creator and sustainer of all things. *"For us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things and we exist for Him."* **(1 Corinthians 8:6)**. He decrees all things for His glory and upholds them by His power. *"Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power... indeed everything that is in the heavens and the earth."* **(1 Chronicles 29:11)**.

## God the Son
Jesus Christ, the second person of the Trinity, is both fully God and fully man. *"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."* **(John 1:1)**. He lived a sinless life, died a substitutionary death, and rose bodily for our justification, *"He who was delivered over because of our transgressions, and was raised because of our justification."* **(Romans 4:25)**. Christ will return in glory to judge the living and the dead and establish His kingdom. *"For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet."* **(1 Corinthians 15:25)**.

## God the Holy Spirit
The Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, is fully God and active in creation, regeneration, and sanctification. *"The Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters."* **(Genesis 1:2)**. He indwells believers, empowers them, and leads them into all truth. *"But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth."* **(John 16:13)**.

# The Decrees of God
God's decrees are His eternal ordinances, encompassing all that will occur. *"He works all things after the counsel of His will."* **(Ephesians 1:11)**. These decrees reflect His sovereignty and holiness, *"The Rock! His work is perfect, for all His ways are just."* **(Deuteronomy 32:4)**.

# The Nature of Man
Man was created in God’s image, *"Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness."* **(Genesis 1:26)**, but this image was marred by sin, *"Through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin."* **(Romans 5:12)**. Humanity is inherently sinful and incapable of seeking God without divine intervention, *"The heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick."* **(Jeremiah 17:9)**.

# What I Believe About Sin
Sin is any deviation from God’s moral law. Originating with Satan, *"Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty."* **(Ezekiel 28:17)**, it entered humanity through Adam. Sin leads to separation from God, *"Your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God."* **(Isaiah 59:2)**. The remedy for sin is found in Jesus Christ, *"He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross."* **(1 Peter 2:24)**.

# Salvation (Soteriology)
Salvation is by grace through faith in Jesus Christ, *"For by grace you have been saved through faith."* **(Ephesians 2:8)**. It involves election, regeneration, justification, sanctification, and glorification, culminating in eternal life. *"Whom He predestined, He also called; and whom He called, He also justified; and whom He justified, He also glorified."* **(Romans 8:30)**.

# The Church
The Church is the body of Christ, composed of all true believers. *"For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body."* **(1 Corinthians 12:13)**. Its purpose is to glorify God, proclaim the gospel, and edify the saints. *"They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship."* **(Acts 2:42)**.

# Heaven and Hell
Heaven is the eternal dwelling place of believers, *"Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men."* **(Revelation 21:3)**, while Hell is the temporary place of torment, culminating in the Lake of Fire, *"And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire."* **(Revelation 20:15)**.

# The Resurrection
The resurrection involves the bodily raising of the dead in Christ and the transformation of living believers. *"The dead in Christ will rise first."* **(1 Thessalonians 4:16)**.

# The Judgment
God’s judgment is holy and just. *"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ."* **(2 Corinthians 5:10)**. Unbelievers will face eternal punishment, *"These will go away into eternal punishment."* **(Matthew 25:46)**.

# The Second Coming of the Messiah
Christ will return visibly and triumphantly, *"They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky."* **(Matthew 24:30)**, to judge the nations and establish His kingdom, *"The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ."* **(Revelation 11:15)**.

# Eternity
Eternity is the final state for all souls, marked by either eternal communion with God or separation from Him, *"And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."* **(Matthew 25:46)**.
